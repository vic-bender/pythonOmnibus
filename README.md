# Vic's Common Python Omnibus

This is a small project I made to help review for Penn State's CMPSC131 class. It contains a lot of common python functions that do a variety of operations with files, lists, and logical operators. For function descriptions, please check comments in the file itself.

Contents:
- Omnibus file in .py format
- Omnibus file in .ipynb format (use if you want nice formatting in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook) - Preferred Option
